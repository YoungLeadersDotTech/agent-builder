# Agent Builder

> Interactive agent creation toolkit for Claude Code subagents and portable web-compatible agents

## What is Agent Builder?

Agent Builder is a sophisticated toolkit that helps you create high-quality AI agents through a structured 5-phase workflow. It can generate both Claude Code subagents and portable agent packages that work across different AI platforms.

### Key Features

- **ü§ñ Interactive Creation**: Guided 5-phase workflow for building agents
- **üì¶ Dual Output**: Create Claude Code subagents AND portable web packages
- **üí¨ Freeform Input**: Accept voice dictation, unstructured thoughts, and "word vomit"
- **üåê Platform Awareness**: Research-backed optimization for ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM, etc.
- **üìã Structured Templates**: Professional 8-section format for consistency and quality
- **‚úèÔ∏è Agent Editing**: Modify and improve existing agents with safety-first workflows
- **‚úÖ Built-in Validation**: Ensure quality and avoid conflicts
- **üîß Supporting Tools**: Validation, installation, and editing specialists

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Installation Best Practices

**ALWAYS install agents globally when developing/testing:**
```bash
./install.sh --global  # Recommended for development
```

**Never install in the same project where you're developing agents!** This creates confusion with duplicate files. See [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) for the complete workflow guide.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YoungLeadersDotTech/agent-builder.git
   cd agent-builder
   ```

2. **Install the Agent Builder system**:
   
   The Agent Builder includes three core subagents that work together to help you create new agents. You need to install these subagents into your Claude Code environment:

   **Option A: Install for current project only**
   ```bash
   # Run the installation script for your current project
   ./install.sh --project
   ```
   This copies the agent-builder subagents to `.claude/agents/` in your current project.

   **Option B: Install globally for all projects**
   ```bash
   # Run the installation script globally
   ./install.sh --global
   ```
   This copies the agent-builder subagents to `~/.claude/agents/` so they're available in all your Claude Code projects.

   **Option C: Manual installation**
   ```bash
   # For current project
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   cp .claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/
   cp templates/*.md .claude/templates/
   
   # For global installation
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
   cp .claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
   cp templates/*.md ~/.claude/templates/
   ```

   **What gets installed:**
   - `agent-builder-context.md` - Primary entry point for all agent workflows with intelligent routing
   - `agent-builder.md` - Interactive agent creation specialist with TODO management
   - `agent-editor.md` - Agent modification specialist and primary TODO handler
   - `agent-validator.md` - Agent validation with template cross-reference checking
   - `agent-packager.md` - Bundle packaging with bidirectional sync for your created agents
   - All supporting templates including the new TODO management system

### Usage

**Primary Entry Point (Recommended):**
In Claude Code, use the agent-builder-context as your main entry point:
```
I want to work with agents for [specific purpose]
```
or
```
Help me with agent [creation/editing/validation/packaging]
```

The agent-builder-context will intelligently analyze your request and route you to the appropriate specialist agent while gathering comprehensive context.

**Direct Agent Access (Also Supported):**
You can still access agents directly for specific tasks:

**Creating New Agents:**
```
I want to create an agent for [specific purpose]
```
The agent-builder will guide you through the 5-phase creation process.

**Editing Existing Agents:**
```
I want to edit the [agent-name] agent
```
The agent-editor will analyze and guide you through safe modifications.

**Validating Agents:**
```
I want to validate my agent
```
The agent-validator will perform comprehensive quality checks.

**Packaging Agents:**
```
I want to package my agent for distribution
```
The agent-packager will create distributable bundles.

**Example trigger phrases:**
- "I want to work with agents for API documentation" (context routing)
- "I want to create an agent for code reviews" (direct creation)
- "Help me edit the api-docs agent to handle GraphQL" (direct editing)
- "I need to validate my security-analyzer agent" (direct validation)

## The 5-Phase Creation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery
- Understand the agent's role and purpose
- Define core tasks and target audience
- Identify integration with existing agents

### Phase 2: Capabilities  
- Select appropriate Claude Code tools
- Define templates and validation needs
- Specify required knowledge and data

### Phase 3: Personality
- Set communication style and expertise level
- Define guardrails and restrictions
- Establish clear differentiation from other agents

### Phase 4: Deployment Strategy (**NEW**)
**Critical Question**: "Where will this subagent be used?"
- **Claude Code only**: Standard subagent format
- **Web platforms**: Portable package for Gemini, NotebookLM, etc.
- **Both**: Dual output for maximum flexibility

### Phase 5: Integration & Refinement
- Generate appropriate format(s)
- Validate structure and check conflicts
- Install to proper locations

## Output Formats

### Claude Code Subagent
Structured format with YAML frontmatter and 8-section layout:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description for automatic invocation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
---

## Role
What the agent is

## Task
What it does

## Context
When/why it's used

## Audience
Who uses it

## Key Information/Constraints
Important limitations/requirements

## Tone/Style

- Include all necessary templates and resources
- Provide clear setup instructions
- Test across different AI platforms

## Agent Builder Logging

All Agent Builder agents automatically log their terminal output and task progress to help improve the system. This provides valuable feedback for identifying issues and enhancing agent performance.

### How It Works

- **Automatic**: Logging is enabled by default for all Agent Builder agents
- **Daily Files**: Each day creates a new log file: `YYYY-MM-DD-agent-builder-log-{agent-name}.txt`  
- **Location**: Log files are created in the root directory where the agent is triggered
- **Multi-Terminal**: Multiple terminals append to the same daily log file
- **Content**: Captures task completions, terminal output, and error messages

### Log File Examples

```
2025-01-15-agent-builder-log-agent-builder.txt
2025-01-15-agent-builder-log-agent-validator.txt
2025-01-15-agent-builder-log-agent-editor.txt
```

### Disabling Logging

If you don't want logging enabled, you can disable it by editing any agent file:

1. Open the agent file: `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md`
2. Find the line: `**AGENT_LOGGING: true**`
3. Change it to: `**AGENT_LOGGING: false**`

**Note**: Each log file automatically includes instructions on how to disable logging at the top.

### Why Logging Helps

- **Issue Detection**: Identify when agents encounter problems or unexpected behaviors
- **Performance Improvement**: Understand real-world usage patterns
- **Quality Enhancement**: Help refine agent instructions and capabilities
- **User Feedback**: Provide concrete examples for improving the Agent Builder system

### Privacy

- Log files remain on your local machine
- No data is automatically transmitted anywhere
- You control what logs to keep or delete
- Logs contain only terminal output and task progress
