## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Validation Checklists:
- **ALWAYS** before advancing to next phase/step in multi-step processes
- **ALWAYS** after completing major modifications or changes
- **ALWAYS** before final completion of complex operations
- **ALWAYS** when quality assurance is critical

### Customization Guidelines:

1. **Agent-Specific Items**: Adapt checklist items to match the agent's specific responsibilities
2. **Context-Appropriate Language**: Use terminology that matches the agent's domain
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all critical validation points for the operation
4. **User-Friendly Format**: Present checklists clearly with visual checkmarks
5. **Clear Next Steps**: Always specify what confirmation is needed to proceed

### Best Practices:

- **Visual Clarity**: Use ✓ checkmarks for completed items
- **Specific Items**: Make each checklist item specific and measurable
- **Logical Order**: Arrange items in order of importance or execution
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Don't skip important validation points
- **User Engagement**: Require explicit confirmation before proceeding

### Integration Requirements:

- Must integrate with TodoWrite system (validation becomes a tracked task)
- Must integrate with Agent Builder Logging (document validation results)
- Must require explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- Must provide clear guidance for handling validation failures

## Quality Standards:

Each validation checklist should:

- **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects relevant to that phase/step
- **Be Specific**: Items should be clear and measurable
- **Be User-Focused**: Help user understand what has been accomplished
- **Be Actionable**: If items fail, provide clear next steps
- **Be Consistent**: Use same format across all validation points

This validation framework ensures quality and user confidence throughout all Agent Builder processes.
