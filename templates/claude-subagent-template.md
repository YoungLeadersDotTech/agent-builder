- **Content**: Task completion status, terminal output, and operation results
- **Format**: Timestamped entries with agent name and task description

After completing each task, append log entry:
```
================================================================================
[$(date)] Agent: [agent-name] | Task: {task-description} | Status: COMPLETED
================================================================================
{relevant task output, terminal results, or error messages}
================================================================================
```
