# Agent Suite Creation - TODO Tracking Document

## Overview
**Created**: 2025-09-14 19:45 IST
**Agent**: agent-builder
**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive agent suite with primary orchestrator and specialized sub-agents
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Context
This TODO documents the creation of a multi-agent suite based on the user's selection of Option B: Primary Agent with Specialized Sub-Agents. The suite will consist of:
- A main orchestrator agent that coordinates workflows and delegates tasks
- Multiple specialized sub-agents with focused capabilities
- Integrated communication and handoff mechanisms between agents
- Unified bundle packaging for easy deployment and distribution

Expected outcomes:
- Complete agent suite with clear role definitions
- Seamless task delegation and coordination capabilities
- Professional-grade agent interactions and error handling
- Ready-to-deploy bundle with comprehensive documentation

## Key Requirements
- Main orchestrator agent with coordination and delegation capabilities
- Specialized sub-agents with clearly defined scope boundaries
- Inter-agent communication protocols and handoff mechanisms
- Unified system prompt architecture with consistent behavioral patterns
- Comprehensive validation and quality assurance for the entire suite
- Bundle packaging with all necessary templates and dependencies

## Agent Assignment
**Primary Agent**: agent-builder
**Supporting Agents**: agent-validator, agent-packager
**Trigger Conditions**: User request for multi-agent suite creation
