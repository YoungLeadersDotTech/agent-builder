# User Journey Mapping Agent Suite Creation TODO

**Task Name**: User Journey Mapping Agent Suite Creation
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Time**: COMPLETED 15:30 IST
**Agent**: agent-builder
**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive suite of agents for user journey mapping with PDF parsing, tag systems, visual elements, and Miro integration
**Status**: COMPLETED - All 6 agents and 7 templates successfully created and bundled

## Context
User requires a sophisticated user journey mapping system with:

- **Template Strategy**: Created 7 custom templates for domain-specific workflows
- **Output Format**: Dual-format package (Claude Code + portable web agent)
- **Bundle Structure**: Complete self-contained package with installation script
- **Future Enhancement**: agent-builder-context orchestrator noted for future implementation

## Created Agents
1. **user-journey-mapper** - Main orchestrator agent
2. **journey-context-extractor** - PDF parsing and context extraction
3. **tag-extractor-agent** - Tag system management
4. **mermaid-generator-agent** - Visual diagram generation
5. **requirements-agent** - Requirements analysis and validation
6. **workshop-agent** - Interactive workshop facilitation

## Created Templates
1. **user-journey-template.md** - Core journey mapping structure
2. **tag-system-template.md** - Comprehensive tag management
3. **visual-elements-template.md** - Miro visual element handling
4. **mermaid-optimization-template.md** - Diagram generation standards
5. **workshop-template.md** - Interactive session management
6. **requirements-template.md** - Analysis and validation protocols
7. **collaboration-template.md** - Integration workflows

## Testing Results
- **YAML Validation**: All 6 agents pass frontmatter validation
- **Markdown Structure**: Proper formatting and structure confirmed
- **Tool Integration**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash tools properly configured
- **Template Dependencies**: All 7 templates correctly referenced and bundled
- **Bundle Structure**: Complete package with proper directory organization
- **Installation Script**: `./install.sh` tested and functional
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated README and MANIFEST.json verified
- **Compatibility**: Full Claude Code ecosystem integration confirmed

## Completion Summary - PROJECT COMPLETED
- **STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED - User Journey Mapping Suite successfully created and validated
- **Bundle Location**: `/Users/johnconneely/Projects/agent-builder/created-agents/user-journey-mapping-suite/`

## Future Enhancement: agent-builder-context Agent

### Problem Identified
The handover from Main Claude to agent-builder is problematic. Users typically have:
- Existing files and documentation
- Custom instructions or context
- Specific requirements and examples
- Templates they want to use

### Current Issue with Templates
**Why agent-builder templates aren't being applied to created agents:**
1. **No automatic template detection**: Agent-builder doesn't scan `/templates/` directory
2. **No template inheritance**: Created agents don't reference agent-builder's templates
3. **Manual template creation**: Agent-builder creates new templates instead of using existing ones
4. **Missing template references**: The agent-builder templates like:
   - `todowrite-integration-template.md`
   - `structured-choice-template.md`
   - `validation-checklist-template.md`
   - `proactive-behavior-template.md`
   Are not being referenced in created agents

### Proposed Solution: agent-builder-context
New orchestrator agent that:
1. **Gathers all context first** - asks for files, documentation, examples, requirements
2. **Identifies relevant templates** - scans and applies templates from `/templates/`
3. **Saves context to file** - stores in `docs/agent-context.md`
4. **Orchestrates builder agents** - calls agent-builder, agent-editor, or agent-validator
5. **Ensures template usage** - Makes sure all relevant templates are referenced

### Templates to Apply to User Journey Suite
From `/Users/johnconneely/Projects/agent-builder/templates/`:
- `todowrite-integration-template.md` - For complex task tracking
- `structured-choice-template.md` - For user decision points
- `validation-checklist-template.md` - For quality assurance
- `proactive-behavior-template.md` - For agent behavior patterns
- `agent-coordination-template.md` - For inter-agent communication
- **Architecture**: Suite+Orchestrator pattern with 6 specialized agents
- **Agents Created**: 6 (user-journey-mapper, journey-context-extractor, tag-extractor-agent, mermaid-generator-agent, requirements-agent, workshop-agent)
- **Templates Created**: 7 custom domain-specific templates
- **Format**: Dual-format (Claude Code + portable web agent)
- **Installation**: Ready - `./install.sh` script created and tested
- **Quality Validation**: All tests passed - structure, syntax, content, functionality
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated README.md and MANIFEST.json included
- **Future Enhancement**: agent-builder-context orchestrator noted for improved handover
- **Deployment Status**: ✅ Ready for immediate installation and use

**Final Validation**: All phases completed successfully. Bundle contains complete working agent suite with all dependencies and documentation. Installation script tested and functional.
